# Standalone conversion worker

Runs the existing model → glTF conversion + thumbnail-rendering pipeline
(`scripts/convert.sh`, `scripts/render.sh`, Blender, the Python converters)
in a container, behind a small HTTP API - no Drupal required.

This is additive: the Drupal-integrated path (`ConvertWorker` queue plugin →
`scripts/worker.sh` → `drush` → `convert.sh`) is untouched and keeps working
exactly as before for the existing instance. This worker is a second, generic
front door onto the same conversion scripts.

## Run it

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:
- `worker` on `:8080` - the conversion API described below.
- `viewer` on `:3000` - a static build of the viewer (`dist/test`) fronted by
  nginx, which reverse-proxies `/api/` and `/files/` to `worker` (see
  `docker/nginx.conf`). This keeps the viewer and the API on the same origin,
  so `viewer/status-poller.js` and the "Upload & convert" panel
  (`viewer/ui/upload-panel.js`) can use plain relative `fetch()` calls -
  exactly like the existing Drupal integration does.

The worker's `:8080` port is still published directly too, for calling the
API from outside the viewer (curl, scripts, etc).

## API

- `POST /api/model/create` - multipart upload, one file field (any name,
  first file part wins). Accepts the formats `scripts/convert.sh` already
  understands (`abc dae fbx obj ply stl wrl x3d ifc blend gml glb`) plus
  `.zip` archives containing one of those. Returns:
  ```json
  { "entity_id": "<job id>", "status": "started" }
  ```
- `GET /api/model/status/<id>` - matches the field names returned by
  `src/Controller/ModelController.php::status()` (`progress`, `status`,
  `message`), plus `modelUrl` / `imageUrls` once the job reaches `ready`:
  ```json
  {
    "progress": 100,
    "status": "ready",
    "message": "Conversion finished",
    "modelUrl": "/files/<id>/gltf/model.glb",
    "imageUrls": ["/files/<id>/views/model_side45.png", "..."]
  }
  ```
  `status` values follow the same vocabulary `viewer/status-poller.js`
  already knows how to render: `preparing`, `processing`, `rendering`,
  `ready`, `failed`.
- `GET /files/<id>/...` - serves the converted model and rendered thumbnails.

## Configuration

Set via environment variables on the `worker` container (see
`worker/Dockerfile` for defaults):

| Variable                  | Default        | Meaning                                   |
|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `WORKER_PORT`              | `8080`         | HTTP listen port                          |
| `WORKER_JOBS_DIR`          | `/data/jobs`   | Where uploads/outputs are stored          |
| `WORKER_SKIP_RENDER`       | `false`        | Skip Blender thumbnail rendering          |
| `WORKER_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`  | `524288000`    | Upload size cap (500 MB)                  |
| `WORKER_CONVERT_TIMEOUT`   | `1800`         | Seconds before a convert.sh call is killed|
| `WORKER_RENDER_TIMEOUT`    | `900`          | Seconds before a render.sh call is killed |
| `WORKER_RENDER_DEVICE`     | `CPU`          | `CPU`, `GPU`, or `AUTO` - see below       |

`SPATH` and `BLENDER_BIN` are set in the image itself (`/app`, `blender`) -
you don't need `scripts/.env` inside the container.

### GPU rendering

Thumbnail rendering (`scripts/render.py`, Cycles) runs on CPU by default.
To use a GPU instead:

1. In `docker-compose.yml`, set `WORKER_RENDER_DEVICE` to `GPU` (fails if no
   GPU is found) or `AUTO` (falls back to CPU silently), and uncomment the
   `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` block on the `worker` service.
2. Install and configure [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
   on the Docker host - required so Docker even knows about an `nvidia`
   device driver (without it, `docker compose up` fails immediately with
   `could not select device driver "nvidia"`, before the container - and
   `try_enable_gpu()`'s own CPU fallback - ever runs). On Ubuntu/Debian:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg

   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
     sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
     sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit

   sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

   The last command restarts the Docker daemon, which restarts every
   container on the host, not just this project - plan around that on a
   shared machine. Only NVIDIA/CUDA and OptiX are exercised on the Python
   side today - `scripts/render.py`'s `try_enable_gpu()` also tries HIP and
   oneAPI backends if present, but those are untested here.

The worker image itself needs no CUDA toolkit - the official Blender
tarball it installs (see `worker/Dockerfile`) bundles its own Cycles GPU
kernels; only the NVIDIA driver's userspace libraries need to reach the
container, which is what the toolkit above provides.

## Known limitations (MVP)

- Job state lives in memory only; restarting the container loses in-flight
  and completed job records (the output files on the `worker-jobs` volume
  survive, only the status lookup by id is lost).
- Archive support is `.zip` only for now - `scripts/convert.sh` itself has no
  built-in archive handling (that logic currently lives in
  `ConvertWorker.php` on the Drupal side), so this worker reimplements just
  enough of it (safe extraction + first-supported-file detection) to be
  useful standalone.
- Uploads are buffered fully in memory before being written to disk; fine for
  the sizes this pipeline already deals with, but not streaming.
